Chapter I Introduction to perhaps more Professionally know as in today's terms that why identify it is cyber attacks. 
The word hacker could be used to help describe what I'm going to walk you through to the best of my abilty to help understand and learn. 
Hopefully the goal is that your learn something in the processes so and help prevent any future attacks that may or may not happen. With out futher or do lets begin.

Summary of bio of writer,
When i was younger i was fasnated with the idea of how and why something works. Of coruse the fact of I always tinkerd with things to see how it may work. When i was a certian age i really devoted my goals to be set on learning thr fundalmentals of computers and how there funtions could be used to be wepanized for destroytion. Take a moment to take that in and study that hard, basiclly a computer when used correctlly like a gun. YOu have to line the gun up at your target, and a computer as to be told by appriote commands to line up the sights too. You load it cock it and fire a gun and a computer you do the same but more or less with commands that are feed by the user nomrally. When a indvial understand the equment they are In a way  useing after a while you become comfortble like a car. In a way your commads lines, codes scripts. If you will are your ammio. Malware like virus bloatware worms and adware are prefect examples of someone preload commands into a line of code the computer will execute. In this case your malware and nasty programs i like too see it as, is basiclly a sucicdial will, A date of when an exuction will be preformed like death row, leathal injections. Like hummans and computer you will find that how i give my prestive on it, Hopefully you will be able to idenfiy the two behviors as much alike. A computer has cords as we have vains. Computer have brains too just not subconiouslly wake. In a way they are controlled and no abilty to form humman interactions such as emtions. True Ai. were a piace of technolgy could paint a picture of art or understand how to read. Hummans in some since though are munipulated just as computers are controlled.

Chapter II 
Getting started is stressfull and overwhelming. you probally dont even know were to start, were to really begen, In this corse the best thing 
is that i will have a way to give my experices of what not to do and where to start. What tips and tricks i learned along the way, So me personally i 
would recommand begaining small like rooting a phone. This way you can play around with little to no knowlage of any kind and you berally have to 
understand how to configure it. All you have to do is download theses sofware examples i will list that will enable to preform attacks, just by an on or 
off switch. Andriod framwork is bult on there applactions being simple as opening it up select the target and click begin that simple. I will warn you 
agin the device your useing regurdless iphone or andriod has to be ROOTED. Meaning you have to obtain Adminastations permision. Open chrome firefox or what 
ever on andriod or iphone, To be honest im not to sure on ipone i have never tryed it. Surch up KINGROOT APK and download the applcation and click trust anyways
when the applcation promphts you about wither you want to trust the applcation or not. The app is a root tool not a virus, me personally i think the terms and 
services you agree to says that you agree to not have any supsious applcations such has hacktools or root kits. This will root your device if its compatable. I 
did this at frist, to really see if i would like it or not, and overall i ended up likey it. So i dug deeper on how are theses attacks carryed out, how are thy formed, 
how do they work. Spifically talking about how dose code be modfiyed to exploite computers. Me personnally i was trested to really know.
